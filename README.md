# Budee Take-Home Project

This is a standard pre-interview take-home project that will be used to evaluate the full-stack expertise of candidates looking to join the team at Budee.


## What you should expect
We understand that spending anything more than **1-2 hours** for a take-home project is ludicrous. Thus, the project options that are available to you are meant to be simple and straight-forward. Due to the size of the project, we expect this to be done in a single session.

We expect the project to be done in **MERN stack with Git** being the version control system.

## What we are looking for
*Treat it like production code*. 

At the very least, **it should have most of the MVPs and deployed on Heroku, AWS, or other PaaS**.


**The project should have a clean architecture, maintainable/scalable code, and well commented/documented**.  Additionally, you should **make frequent commits** to the repository with a concise commit title based on the code change.


## How should you submit
Please email the link to the solution and its source code to [engineer@budee.org](mailto:engineer@budee.org) or reply to one of our jobs ad

## Project Options
### Option: Checker
**Prompt**
* The candidate should replicate the classic Checker boardgame.

**MVP**
* Checkered board
* Circle piece
* Square piece
* A piece should movable using directional-key
* When a circle piece reached an edge, it should transform into a square piece
* The game should automatically save before the browser close (don't use clientside storage)
* A reset button, when clicked, the game will reset
